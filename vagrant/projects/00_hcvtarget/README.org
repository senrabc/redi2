** Version information
This data was tested with redcap version 6.16.8 and it requires removing two of the values from
the text_validation_type_or_show_slider_number header. The offending fields are
- subject_id
- year_only

These may work in a different redcap version and any more information should be placed in this 
file when it is found out
